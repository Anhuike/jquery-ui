{"body":"[jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) - Interactions and Widgets for the web\r\n================================\r\n\r\njQuery UI provides interactions like Drag and Drop and widgets like Autocomplete, Tabs and Slider and makes these as easy to use as jQuery itself.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use jQuery UI, go to [jqueryui.com](http://jqueryui.com) to get started. Or visit the [Using jQuery UI Forum](http://forum.jquery.com/using-jquery-ui) for discussions and questions.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in helping developing jQuery UI, you are in the right place.\r\nTo discuss development with team members and the community, visit the [Developing jQuery UI Forum](http://forum.jquery.com/developing-jquery-ui).\r\n\r\nFor contributors\r\n---\r\nIf you want to help and provide a patch for a bugfix or new feature, please take\r\na few minutes and look at [our Getting Involved guide](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/35263114/Getting-Involved),\r\nin particular check out the [Coding standards](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137737/Coding-standards)\r\nand [Commit Message Style Guide](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/25941597/Commit-Message-Style-Guide).\r\n\r\nIn general, fork the project, create a branch for a specific change and send a\r\npull request for that branch. Don't mix unrelated changes. You can use the commit\r\nmessage as the description for the pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor committers\r\n---\r\nWhen looking at pull requests, first check for [proper commit messages](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137724/Bug-Fixing-Guide).\r\n\r\nUnless everything is fine and you can merge directly via GitHub's interface, fetch the remote first:\r\n\r\n    git remote add [username] [his-fork.git] -f\r\n\r\nIf you want just one commit and edit the commit message:\r\n\r\n    git cherry-pick -e [sha-of-commit]\r\n\r\nIf it should go to the stable brach, cherry-pick it to stable:\r\n\r\n    git checkout 1-8-stable\r\n    git cherry-pick -x [sha-of-commit]\r\n","name":"jquery-ui","tagline":"The official jQuery user interface library.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
